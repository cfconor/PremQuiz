# **THIS IS A W.I.P BRANCH**
I am currently working on overhauling the original JS client-side based site with a Flask-based solution, in order to learn more about the uses and features of Python and Flask in web development. I may re-integrate some JS or similar features in order to provide some client-side functionality on top, but thats a story for a later date!
